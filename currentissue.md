# Current Issue

## Overview
This file tracks the current work in progress for the LazyMagic project.

## Current Task
A screen refresh issue.



## Context
Projects:
- LazyMagic.Blazor
	- WindowFade.razor
- BlazorTest.WASM

## Behavior
Sometimes the resize event doesn't trigger a screen refresh, causing the UI to not update correctly. Specifically, the opacity of the page remains 0 instead of transitioning to 1. 

To reproduce this I just resize my window width. If I resize the depth, it works properly.

## Progress
- [x] Examined WindowFade.razor component to understand resize event handling
- [x] Investigated why width resize doesn't trigger opacity transition  
- [x] Fixed the resize event handling for width changes
- [ ] Test the fix in BlazorTest.WASM

## Notes
The issue was in the WindowFade.razor component. The resize callback wasn't triggering a proper re-render cycle. 

### Current state:
- WindowResize.razor appears to have been modified to include fade functionality
- WindowFade.razor is a separate component that also handles fade-in
- Both components exist and seem to have overlapping functionality
- Changes to HandleResize() have been reverted to original approach using StateHasChanged

### Original issue:
The StateHasChanged() call in HandleResize wasn't reliably triggering OnAfterRenderAsync, particularly for width-only resizes, causing the opacity to remain at 0.

## Next Steps
Test the fix by running BlazorTest.WASM and resizing the window width to verify the opacity transitions properly from 0 to 1.
