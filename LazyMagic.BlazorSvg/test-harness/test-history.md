# Test History and Observations

## Test Run 1 - Baseline (2025-10-01)

### Configuration
- Algorithm: `fastInscribedRectangle`
- Validation threshold: 98% coverage
- Grid step: 12.0px
- Angle samples: Multiple angles tested

### Results

#### Test01 (Ballroom_1 + Ballroom_3)
- **Coverage**: 85.9% (18,338 / 21,353 sq px)
- **Found**: 214.1 √ó 85.6 px at 9¬∞ angle
- **Target**: ~219 √ó 95 px (approximate from area)
- **Polygon**: 6 vertices, relatively simple rectangular shape
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (below 98%)

**Observations**:
- Algorithm found a well-aligned rectangle at 9¬∞ (matches target angle of ~9.18¬∞)
- Size is close but slightly smaller than target in both dimensions
- Boundary polygon is clean with 6 vertices (two rectangles joined)
- **Issue**: The algorithm is being conservative - likely stopping scaling too early

#### Test02 (Ballroom_1 + Ballroom_Aisle_12 + Ballroom_2)
- **Coverage**: 78.5% (17,609 / 22,437 sq px)
- **Found**: 111.0 √ó 158.6 px at 9¬∞ angle
- **Target**: ~113 √ó 198 px (approximate from area)
- **Polygon**: 8 vertices, L-shaped or complex boundary
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (below 98%)

**Observations**:
- Algorithm found correct orientation (9¬∞)
- Significant gap in coverage (~21% missing)
- Found rectangle appears to have wrong aspect ratio (too narrow/tall vs target)
- **Issue**: Algorithm may not be exploring the full space or is being blocked by polygon concavity

#### Test03 (Ballroom_1 + Ballroom_Aisle_12 + Ballroom_2 + Ballroom_4)
- **Coverage**: 76.8% (17,227 / 22,437 sq px)
- **Found**: 185.6 √ó 92.8 px at 9¬∞ angle
- **Target**: ~155 √ó 145 px (approximate from area)
- **Polygon**: More complex multi-room configuration
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (below 98%)

**Observations**:
- Worst coverage of all three tests
- Found rectangle has very different proportions than target
- Algorithm found wide/short rectangle, but target suggests more square
- **Issue**: Complex polygon causing algorithm to miss optimal solution

### Key Insights

1. **Angle Detection Working Well**: All tests correctly identified ~9¬∞ as optimal angle
2. **Conservative Scaling**: Algorithm consistently undershoots the target area
3. **Aspect Ratio Issues**: Tests 02 and 03 show significant aspect ratio mismatches
4. **Complexity Impact**: Coverage degrades with polygon complexity (85.9% ‚Üí 78.5% ‚Üí 76.8%)

### Hypotheses for Improvement

1. **Grid Resolution**: Current 12px grid step may be too coarse for fine-tuning
   - Test: Reduce to 6px or 8px

2. **Binary Search Tolerance**: Algorithm may be stopping search too early
   - Test: Adjust convergence criteria in binary search

3. **Aspect Ratio Sampling**: May not be testing enough aspect ratios
   - Current: 7 aspect ratios (0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0)
   - Test: Add more samples, especially around discovered optima

4. **Ray Casting Accuracy**: Point-in-polygon tests may have tolerance issues
   - Test: Review SpatialGrid cell size and tolerance parameters

5. **Centroid Selection**: Pole of inaccessibility may not be optimal starting point
   - Test: Try multiple starting centroids from grid

### Next Actions

1. Add detailed logging to see where algorithm stops scaling
2. Visualize the ray-casting results to see if boundaries are being detected correctly
3. Experiment with parameter adjustments:
   - Reduce grid step to 8px
   - Add more aspect ratio samples
   - Adjust binary search tolerance
4. Create parameter sweep test to find optimal configuration

## Test Run 2 - Parameter Sweep (2025-10-01)

### Summary

Tested 6 different parameter configurations to identify optimal settings. **Best configuration: "More Aspect Ratios"** with avg 80.2% coverage.

| Parameter Set | Test01 | Test02 | Test03 | Avg Coverage |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **More Aspect Ratios** | **93.3%** | **86.6%** | 60.6% | **80.2%** |
| Baseline (Current) | 85.9% | 78.5% | 76.8% | 80.4% |
| Aggressive | 90.2% | **89.4%** | 40.6% | 73.4% |
| Finer Grid | 90.2% | 83.3% | 56.8% | 76.8% |
| Fine Tuned Binary Search | 85.9% | 78.5% | 61.3% | 75.2% |
| Very Fine Grid | 90.0% | 83.8% | 46.4% | 73.4% |

### Key Findings

1. **Aspect Ratio Sampling is Critical**
   - "More Aspect Ratios" (13 samples) achieved best Test01 (93.3%) and Test02 (86.6%)
   - Adding aspect ratios [0.6, 0.85, 1.2, 1.7, 2.3, 2.8] improved coverage by 7-8%
   - Suggests algorithm needs finer granularity in aspect ratio search space

2. **Grid Step Has Mixed Effects**
   - Finer grids (8px, 6px) improved Test01/Test02 but **degraded Test03**
   - Test03 went from 76.8% (baseline) to 56.8% (8px) to 46.4% (6px)
   - Hypothesis: Finer grids find sub-optimal local maxima in complex polygons

3. **Binary Search Tuning Had No Effect**
   - Fine Tuned Binary Search showed identical results to Baseline
   - Suggests algorithm is not being limited by convergence tolerance
   - Binary search likely reaching valid boundaries before hitting precision limit

4. **Complex Polygons Are Problematic**
   - Test03 (10 vertices) consistently underperforms (40-77% coverage)
   - Coverage degrades with polygon complexity across all configurations
   - Algorithm struggles with multi-room configurations

5. **Aggressive Configuration Backfired**
   - Combining all optimizations produced **worst** Test03 result (40.6%)
   - Grid √ó Aspect interactions may create optimization interference
   - More parameters ‚â† better results

### Detailed Observations

#### Test01 (6 vertices, simple L-shape)
- **Best**: More Aspect Ratios at 93.3% (19,916 sq px / 21,353 target)
- Improved from 85.9% ‚Üí 93.3% by adding aspect ratio samples
- Finer grids also helped (90.0-90.2%)
- **Remaining gap**: 1,436 sq px (6.7%) suggests near-optimal

#### Test02 (8 vertices, medium complexity)
- **Best**: Aggressive at 89.4% (20,063 sq px / 22,442 target)
- More Aspect Ratios: 86.6%
- Shows benefit of combined fine grid + more aspects
- **Remaining gap**: 2,379 sq px (10.6%)

#### Test03 (10 vertices, high complexity)
- **Best**: Baseline at 76.8% (17,227 sq px / 22,442 target)
- All "improved" configs actually degraded performance!
- **Worst**: Aggressive at 40.6% (lost 36% coverage)
- **Critical issue**: Algorithm fundamentally struggles with complex shapes

### Root Cause Analysis

**Test03 Degradation Mystery**:
- Why does Test03 fail with finer grids?
- Hypothesis 1: Finer grids generate more candidate centroids, time limit (100ms) cuts search short
- Hypothesis 2: Finer grids find "attracto

r basins" around sub-optimal local maxima
- Hypothesis 3: Complex polygon has concave regions that confuse centroid selection

**Action Items for Next Iteration**:
1. **Disable time limit** for Test03 to test Hypothesis 1
2. **Visualize centroids** tested in Test03 to see spatial distribution
3. **Test hybrid approach**: Baseline grid for complex polygons, fine grid for simple
4. **Investigate aspect ratio 2.3-2.8 range** - may be sweet spot for Test01/02

### Recommended Configuration

For production use, recommend **"More Aspect Ratios"** with modification:

```javascript
{
    gridStep: 12.0,  // Keep baseline grid (finer hurts Test03)
    polylabelPrecision: 1.0,
    aspectRatios: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.85, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0],  // +6 samples
    binarySearchPrecision: 0.001,  // No benefit from finer
    binarySearchMaxIterations: 15
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- Test01: 93.3% (vs 85.9% baseline)
- Test02: 86.6% (vs 78.5% baseline)
- Test03: ~77% (maintain baseline performance)
- Average: ~85% (vs 80.4% baseline)

**Still short of 98% target**, but significant improvement. Test03 requires deeper algorithmic changes.

## Test Run 3 - Extended Time Limit (2025-10-01)

### Configuration Change
Increased `maxTime` from 100ms to 1000ms to test if time limit was causing Test03 failures.

### Results - BREAKTHROUGH! üéâ

| Parameter Set | Test01 | Test02 | Test03 | Avg Coverage | Avg Time |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | 90.2% | **89.4%** | **89.4%** | **89.7%** | 1000ms |
| More Aspect Ratios | **93.3%** | 86.6% | 86.6% | 88.9% | 787ms |
| Very Fine Grid | 90.0% | 83.8% | 83.8% | 85.8% | 1000ms |
| Finer Grid | 90.2% | 83.3% | 83.3% | 85.6% | 916ms |
| Baseline (Current) | 85.9% | 78.5% | 78.5% | 80.9% | 539ms |
| Fine Tuned Binary Search | 85.9% | 78.5% | 78.5% | 80.9% | 550ms |

### Key Findings

1. **TIME LIMIT WAS THE BOTTLENECK! ‚úì**
   - Test03 jumped from **40-77%** to **83-89%** coverage!
   - Hypothesis 1 **CONFIRMED**: 100ms was cutting search short on complex polygons
   - All configurations that previously hurt Test03 now help it

2. **Aggressive Configuration is Now Best Overall**
   - Avg coverage: **89.7%** (up from 73.4% with 100ms limit)
   - Consistent performance across all three tests (90.2%, 89.4%, 89.4%)
   - Uses full 1000ms budget (worth the time for quality)

3. **More Aspect Ratios Best for Simple Polygons**
   - Test01: **93.3%** (best result)
   - Test02/03: 86.6%
   - Completes in 787ms (under 1s limit)
   - Good balance of speed and quality

4. **Test03 Improvements by Configuration**
   - Baseline: 78.5% (was 76.8% @ 100ms)
   - Finer Grid: 83.3% (was 56.8% @ 100ms) - **+26.5% improvement!**
   - Aggressive: 89.4% (was 40.6% @ 100ms) - **+48.8% improvement!**

### Analysis

**Why finer grids need more time:**
- 8px grid: ~3.5√ó more centroids than 12px (area ratio: (12/8)¬≤ = 2.25, but with strategic sampling ~3.5√ó)
- 6px grid: ~8√ó more centroids than 12px
- Each centroid tests multiple angles (12¬∞ steps + refinement)
- Complex polygon (Test03) needs more centroid exploration

**Performance scaling:**
- Baseline (12px grid): 539ms average
- Finer Grid (8px): 916ms average (+70%)
- Aggressive (8px + more aspects): 1000ms (hitting limit)
- More Aspect Ratios (12px): 787ms (+46%)

**Time vs Quality tradeoff:**
- 100ms limit: max 80.4% avg coverage
- 1000ms limit: up to 89.7% avg coverage
- **+9.3% coverage for +900ms** = excellent ROI for quality-critical use case

### Recommended Production Configuration

**"Aggressive" for best coverage** (if 1s latency acceptable):

```javascript
{
    gridStep: 8.0,                    // Fine grid for better centroid sampling
    polylabelPrecision: 0.5,          // Higher precision pole finding
    aspectRatios: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.85, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0],
    binarySearchPrecision: 0.0001,    // Fine-tuned convergence
    binarySearchMaxIterations: 20,
    maxTime: 1000                     // Allow full second for quality
}
```

**Results**: 89.7% avg (90.2%, 89.4%, 89.4%)

**"More Aspect Ratios" for speed** (if <800ms latency required):

```javascript
{
    gridStep: 12.0,                   // Standard grid
    polylabelPrecision: 1.0,
    aspectRatios: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.85, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0],
    binarySearchPrecision: 0.001,
    binarySearchMaxIterations: 15,
    maxTime: 1000
}
```

**Results**: 88.9% avg (93.3%, 86.6%, 86.6%) in 787ms

### Still Missing ~10% for 98% Target

Current best: **89.7%** average, still **8.3%** short of target.

**Remaining gaps by test:**
- Test01: 93.3% ‚Üí need +4.7% (1,436 sq px)
- Test02: 89.4% ‚Üí need +8.6% (2,379 sq px)
- Test03: 89.4% ‚Üí need +8.6% (2,379 sq px)

**Possible next steps to close gap:**
1. **Even more aspect ratios**: Test 0.05 increments around sweet spots (2.3-2.8 range)
2. **Adaptive angle refinement**: Currently using fixed 2¬∞ steps, could use binary search on angle
3. **Polygon decomposition**: Break complex shapes into simpler sub-polygons
4. **Iterative expansion**: Start with conservative rectangle, try to expand iteratively
5. **Allow longer time (2-5s)**: See if additional time continues to improve

**Critical question**: Is 90% "good enough" for the use case, or must we reach 98%?
