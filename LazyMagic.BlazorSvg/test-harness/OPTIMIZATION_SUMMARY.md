# Algorithm Optimization Summary

## Executive Summary

Through systematic parameter sweeps and iterative testing, we improved the inscribed rectangle algorithm coverage from **80.4%** to **89.7%** average across all test cases - a **+9.3% improvement**.

### Key Achievement
- **Test01**: 85.9% → 90.2% (+4.3%)
- **Test02**: 78.5% → 89.4% (+10.9%)
- **Test03**: 76.8% → 89.4% (+12.6%)
- **Average**: 80.4% → 89.7% (+9.3%)

## Root Cause Identified

The primary bottleneck was the **100ms time limit**, which was insufficient for complex polygons with finer grid sampling:

- Complex polygon (Test03) with baseline grid: ~540ms needed
- Same polygon with fine grid (8px): ~1000ms needed
- **Finer grids generate 3-8× more candidate centroids**, each requiring angle testing

## Optimized Configuration

### Production Settings ("Aggressive")

```javascript
{
    maxTime: 1000,                     // Extended from 100ms
    gridStep: 8.0,                     // Finer grid (was 12.0)
    polylabelPrecision: 0.5,           // Higher precision (was 1.0)
    aspectRatios: [                    // 13 samples (was 7)
        0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.85, 1.0,
        1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0
    ],
    binarySearchPrecision: 0.0001,     // Finer (was 0.001)
    binarySearchMaxIterations: 20      // More iterations (was 15)
}
```

**Results**: 89.7% average coverage in ~1000ms

### Performance vs Quality Tradeoff

| Configuration | Avg Coverage | Avg Time | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Baseline | 80.9% | 539ms | Speed-critical |
| More Aspect Ratios | 88.9% | 787ms | Balanced |
| **Aggressive** | **89.7%** | **1000ms** | **Quality-critical** |

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- Automated parameter sweep framework
- 6 different configurations tested
- 3 test cases (simple → complex polygons)
- Results tracked in markdown with detailed analysis

### 2. Parameters Tested
- **Grid Step**: 6px, 8px, 12px
- **Polylabel Precision**: 0.5, 1.0
- **Aspect Ratios**: 7 samples vs 13 samples
- **Binary Search**: Precision and iteration limits
- **Time Limit**: 100ms vs 1000ms

### 3. Key Insights Discovered

1. **Aspect Ratio Sampling is Critical**
   - Adding 6 more aspect ratios improved Test01 by 7.4%
   - Sweet spots around 0.6, 0.85, 1.2, 1.7, 2.3, 2.8

2. **Grid Fineness Helps with Adequate Time**
   - 8px grid outperforms 12px when given sufficient time
   - But causes 48% degradation with 100ms limit

3. **Binary Search Tuning Had Minimal Impact**
   - Precision 0.001 vs 0.0001: no significant difference
   - Not the optimization bottleneck

4. **Polygon Complexity Matters**
   - 6 vertices: 90-93% coverage achievable
   - 8 vertices: 86-89% coverage
   - 10 vertices: 83-89% coverage
   - More vertices = harder optimization

## Remaining Gap to 98% Target

Current best: **89.7%**, need **+8.3%** more

### Gap Analysis by Test
- Test01: 90.2% → 98% = **+1,663 sq px** needed
- Test02: 89.4% → 98% = **+1,930 sq px** needed
- Test03: 89.4% → 98% = **+1,930 sq px** needed

### Potential Next Steps

1. **Even Finer Aspect Ratio Sampling**
   - Try 0.05 increments in 2.0-3.0 range
   - Current best Test01 used aspect ratio 2.5

2. **Adaptive Angle Refinement**
   - Current: Fixed 2° refinement steps
   - Proposed: Binary search on angle for local optima

3. **Allow More Time (2-5 seconds)**
   - Test if additional computation continues to improve
   - Diminishing returns likely, but worth testing

4. **Algorithmic Changes**
   - Polygon decomposition for complex shapes
   - Iterative rectangle expansion from conservative start
   - Multi-start optimization from different centroids

5. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use different parameters based on polygon complexity
   - Simple polygons: More aspect ratios (faster)
   - Complex polygons: Aggressive (thorough)

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

**Use "Aggressive" configuration** if quality is paramount and 1s latency is acceptable:
- Achieves 89.7% average coverage
- Consistent across all polygon complexities
- Worth the performance cost for quality

**Use "More Aspect Ratios"** if <800ms latency required:
- Achieves 88.9% average coverage
- Completes in ~787ms
- Good balance of speed and quality

### For Further Optimization

1. **Accept 90% as "good enough"** - diminishing returns beyond this point
2. **Or invest in algorithmic improvements** - 8% gap likely requires architectural changes
3. **Consider use-case requirements** - Is 98% coverage truly necessary?

## Conclusion

The optimization effort successfully:
- ✅ Identified and fixed the time limit bottleneck
- ✅ Improved average coverage by 9.3% (80.4% → 89.7%)
- ✅ Created systematic testing infrastructure
- ✅ Documented findings for future iterations
- ⚠️ Still 8.3% short of 98% target (may require architectural changes)

The algorithm now performs well for practical use cases, with consistent ~90% coverage across polygon complexities.
